 2. Word Length -> Prints all the words with fixed number of letters.
 3. Search Word -> Prints all the documents in which a word is present.
 
 How to run this code?
      To run this code, we need to clone this repo and compile all the files in src directory. After compiling, we need to run the command java MapReduce from the current directory. MapReduce.java is the main class calling mapper and reducer classes.
