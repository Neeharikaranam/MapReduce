Health is wealth.
The flowers bloom in Spring.
The terrain is rocky.
Himalayas, are a mountain range.
The waves are blue.
The apartment complex is far from the college.
It's a beautiful town.
The shop, in downtown is good for groceries.
Its a small world....
Earth is round.
Gravity doesn't exist... on the moon.
